Create a simple content management system that allows users to view, add, delete, and update books. Books entered in the system can be viewed in a list, as a single entry on its own page, or searched for using basic searches (by title, author, or genre).

Code is well tested and all tests are passing.

Stories
Users can add books into the bookstore system via an admin page (create)
Users can edit a book's title, author, or genre (update)
Users can delete a book from the bookstore (delete)
Users can search for books by title OR by author OR by genre (read)
Users can view book details on a book detail page (read)
Lists of books are always paginated in groups of 10
Book detail view is linked to from the listing and search pages
Search results are presented in a new page

Stretch
App is deployed and live on the web (consider using Heroku)
All source code is written with ES6
Users have their own account and can sign up and sign in/out
Users have one of three roles: admin, clerk, reader
Users with role reader can only view and search for books
Users with role clerk can edit books in addition to viewing/searching
Users with role admin can perform all actions (create, read, update, delete) with books
Books have a price, cover image, publisher, and ISBN number
